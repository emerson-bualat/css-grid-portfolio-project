I've created a portfolio app that's designed to showcase my web development skills, with a particular focus on improving my proficiency in CSS Grid. 
As a beginner in this area, I'm using this app as an opportunity to practice and refine my CSS Grid skills, 
experimenting with different layouts and design features to see what works best.

Through this app, I hope to demonstrate my progress and growth as a web developer, 
showing potential clients or employers that I'm committed to learning and improving my skills. 
While I may not yet be an expert in CSS Grid, I'm excited to continue working on this technology and developing my abilities in this area.

The app itself is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a simple layout that's optimized for showcasing my portfolio projects. 
By focusing on CSS Grid, I'm able to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, improving the overall user experience.

Overall, I'm really excited about this app and the opportunities it provides for me to grow and develop as a web developer. 
By focusing on CSS Grid, I'm confident that I'll be able to create stunning layouts that really showcase my skills and abilities.
